# Connect Four AI

Proudly created with the burning desire for revenge

## How does it work?

This solver is powered by the [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm,
which looks at possible future moves and calculates a score for the corresponding game states
in order to find the optimal move to make in order to maximize the score gained.

It also implements [Alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning),
which cuts down on computation time by skipping simulating unnecessary moves.

## Why did you make this?

My friend beat me at Connect Four last night when we were texting so I thought about it,
went "yeah, I could do that" and made this in order to shame them.

Also I thought it would be pretty funny
